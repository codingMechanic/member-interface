# member-interface
A custom member administration and booking system.

This project makes use of client-sided backbone.js and server-sided Java JSP technologies to provide an association members' administration system.
Features include management of address and personal data, a filter function for certain member types as well as an email and a newsletter implementation.
Furthermore, the jQuery based "fullcalendar" library has been used to implement a booking system attached to the user interface.
